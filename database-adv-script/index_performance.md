# Expected Performance Improvements

    Join operations will be significantly faster with indexes on foreign keys

    Date range queries will benefit from the booking_date index

    Sorting operations will be more efficient with proper indexes

    Composite indexes will help queries that filter on multiple columns

# Implementation Notes

    Run the database_index.sql script to create all indexes

    Test critical queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE before and after

    Monitor database performance after index creation

    Consider adding or removing indexes based on actual query patterns

    Be aware that indexes improve read performance but may slightly slow down writes
